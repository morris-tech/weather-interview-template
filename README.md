# weather-interview-template
A barebones HTML, CSS and JS template representing a website for displaying weather related information that 
is used as part of a technical interview.

## Instructions

Create a website that displays basic weather information to the user. It is up to you to decide what information and 
how to display that information to the user, however for this exercise you are limited to the information 
available in the JSON file `data/forecast.json`.

This project should be completed in the following order:

1. Discuss the different components and pieces of the site that are needed.

2. Design the structure of the site. Use a whiteboard or piece of paper and sketch out a wireframe design  of the site. 
You are also welcome to use software such as Adobe Illustrator or Adobe Photoshop to create a mockup for the site.

3. Take the boilerplate template `index.html` and create the layout and design based on your previous
wireframe/mockup. Use the `src/index.css` file to add your styling to the page. 
Feel free to use hardcoded values as placeholders, later we will make it dynamic.

4. Pull data from the `data/forecast.json` file and display it on the page. jQuery has been made available on the page.
All javascript can be written in `src/weather.js`.
